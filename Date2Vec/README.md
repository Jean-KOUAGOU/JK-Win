# Date2Vec

This repository was initially cloned from https://github.com/ojus1/Time2Vec-PyTorch, then modified for my needs.

In more detail, I (randomly) generated temporal values (year, day, hour, minute, seconds) from 1950 to 2050 using the generate_data.py file. Then I trained time embeddings with this framework using the ```Experiment.py``` file.
